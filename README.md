<i>CodiNames</i> - it's like CodeNames but with an i.

To start, you'll need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once that's installed, you'll need to run the following in the checkout directory

```
npm install -g nodemon
npm install
```

You can then start the web server:

```
npm start
```
