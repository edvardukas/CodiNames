    <h2>How to play CodiNames</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The aim of the game is to determine, with help of your spymaster, which cards belong to your team.</li>
        <li>PLlayers are divided into 2 teams of equal size and roles are randomly placed throughout the board</li>
        <li>The roles are red team, blue team, bystander, and assassin</li>
        <li>The spymaster will take turns giving a clue which consists of a word and a number, where the number refers the number of cards that the clue refers to</li>
        <li>You may not give a clue that is a word that is on, or consists of a word on the table</li>
        <li>Upon hearing a clue from their spymaster, the team will guess choose one of the cards on the table</li>
        <li>Once a card is picked, it flips over and one of four things can happen:
            <ol>If it is a card of your own colour, you may take another turn</ol>
            <ol>If it is a card of the other teams colour, it becomes their turn</ol>
            <ol>If it is an innocent bystander, it also becomes the other teams turn</ol>
            <ol>If it is the assassin, your team loses the game</ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
